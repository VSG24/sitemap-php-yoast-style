# sitemap-php-yoast-style
Library for generating Google sitemap XML files with respect to naming and grouping conventions from Yoast

This project is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/o/sitemap-php">sitemap-php</a>.
For documentation please visit the original fork as there are no differences in usage in my fork.

The only difference between the original project and this fork is the generated file names and file groups in index xml file.
